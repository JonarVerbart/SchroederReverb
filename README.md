# SchroederReverb

This is a Schroeder reverb build in C++ using Jack Audio. The reverb is based on the schematic on this page: https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Schroeder_Reverberators.html

Be carefull when running this code, especially when using headphones. This reverb doesn't sound amazing and is very prone to feedback.
